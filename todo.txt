GENERAL
- Find some better fonts to try out.

- Make the site mobile first by using min-width in the media querys instead of max-width.

- Look into setting up the viewport more indepth. I have a 'meta' tag set but it just sets the scale to 1 for now.

HOME
- Make the featuredContent generate with a FOR loop based on a JSON file so that adding or removing 
featured content. Also simpler for someone else to edit without touching the layout.

ABOUT
- Make the social media links on the gamer bio cards into pretty buttons.

Done - Fix the responsive design.

HEADER

- Make the header menu turn into a hamburger menu for the smaller resolutions or an alternative.

- Fix header image size.

Done - Make the header image a link to the home page.

Done - Comment out currently unused links in the header and footer menu.


BREAK-POINTS
Done - Break point 760 on the home page is causing uncentered content. 


SLIDESHOW
- Replace the few w3 css classes that are being used in the slideshow so that 
we can remove the w3 link.

- Make the slideshow stop changing while the mouse is hovering over the slideshow.

Future - Rework the controls. Move the dots to just underneath the center of the slides. 
Also move the arrows outside of the slides. I'm thinking vertically centered on
the sides of the slides.

Done - Remove debug logging for the slideshow.

Done - Make the slides change every few seconds.

Done - Descide weather or not to make the slideshow go to the edges of the outer 
container or not. I plan on leaving it how it is now.


STREAM
Done - Make the stream resize actively while retaining its aspect ratio.

Done - Refine the responsive design, the smaller resolutions need work.


THEMING
- Start testing colors out

- Look into how to change css with a button.

Done - Make a test theme that overwrites the dev css colors etc.

Done - Separate the header and footer so they can be added to the other pages.
