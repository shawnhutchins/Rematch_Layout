GENERAL
- Find some better fonts to try out.

- Look into setting up the viewport more indepth. I have a 'meta' tag set but it 
just sets the scale to 1 for now.


HOME

- Use the youtube api to get the TITLE and Date. Will allow user to just enter a 
url and the rest will do it on its own.

featured content. Also simpler for someone else to edit without touching the layout.

BREAK-POINTS
Done - Break point 760 on the home page is causing uncentered content. 


SLIDESHOW
- Replace the few w3 css classes that are being used in the slideshow so that 
we can remove the w3 link.

- Make the slideshow stop changing while the mouse is hovering over the slideshow.

Future - Rework the controls. Move the dots to just underneath the center of the slides. 
Also move the arrows outside of the slides. I'm thinking vertically centered on
the sides of the slides.

Done - Remove debug logging for the slideshow.

Done - Make the slides change every few seconds.

Done - Descide weather or not to make the slideshow go to the edges of the outer 
container or not. I plan on leaving it how it is now.
