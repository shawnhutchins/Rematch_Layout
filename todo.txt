SLIDESHOW
- Replace the few w3 css classes that are being used in the slideshow so that 
we can remove the w3 link.

- Rework the controls. Maybe get rid of the arrows and just have the dots, or 
move the arrows up to the center of the sides and make them fade away when not
moused over.

Done - Make the slides change every few seconds.

- Descide weather or not to make the slideshow go to the edges of the outer 
container or not.

- Finalize the responsive design.

STREAM
Done - Make the stream resize actively while retaining its aspect ratio.

Done - Refine the responsive design, the smaller resolutions need work.

THEMING
- Start testing colors out

- Look into how to change css with a button.

- Make a test theme that overwrites the dev css colors etc.

Done - Separate the header and footer so they can be added to the other pages.
