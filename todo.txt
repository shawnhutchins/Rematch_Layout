- Replace the few w3 css classes that are being used in the slideshow so that 
we can remove the w3 link.

- Once the site is on a server separate the header and footer so they can be 
added to the other pages.

- left off making the routes work to the about page and stream page. Still 
need to tell them where their css was moved too.
